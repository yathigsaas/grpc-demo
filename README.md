# gRPC Demo Project

A demonstration of gRPC-based microservices communication using Spring Boot and Protocol Buffers.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a microservices architecture with gRPC for inter-service communication. It consists of two main services:

1. **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and management
2. **Customer Service**: Manages customer-related operations and demonstrates service-to-service communication with Auth Service

## Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Gradle 7.6+
- Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc)

## Technology Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.5.0**
- **gRPC 1.58.0**
- **Protocol Buffers 3.25.1**
- **Spring gRPC 2.15.0**

## Getting Started

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd grpc-demo
   ```

2. Build all services:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

### Running the Services

1. Start the Auth Service:
   ```bash
   cd auth-service
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

2. Start the Customer Service (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd customer-service
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

## API Documentation

### Auth Service gRPC API

The Auth Service exposes the following gRPC endpoints:

- **Create User**: `UserService/CreateUser`
- **Get User**: `UserService/GetUser`
- **Get All Users**: `UserService/GetAllUsers`
- **Update User**: `UserService/UpdateUser`
- **Delete User**: `UserService/DeleteUser`

### Protocol Buffers

The gRPC service definitions can be found in:
- `auth-service/src/main/proto/user.proto`

## Configuration

### Auth Service

Configuration file: `auth-service/src/main/resources/application.yml`

### Customer Service

Configuration file: `customer-service/src/main/resources/application.yml`

## Development

### Code Generation

Protocol buffer code is automatically generated during the build process. After making changes to `.proto` files, run:

```bash
./gradlew generateProto
```

### Testing

Run tests for all services:

```bash
./gradlew test
```
